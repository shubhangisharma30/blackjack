# Blackjack

The program uses a deck of cards and deals two cards to both the player and the dealer. 

It then prompts the player to either "stay" with their current hand or "hit" to request another card. 

The dealer continues to draw cards until their total is greater than 16.

Once both the player and dealer have finished drawing cards, the program determines the winner by comparing the total value of each hand. 
If a hand's total value exceeds 21, it busts and loses the game.
